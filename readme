This directory contains a basic C compiler (BCC), developed as part of the
computer system course of the fourth year of computer and network studies at
INSA Toulouse.

This compiler supports a simplified syntax of the C language, including
mathematical operations, loops and functions. It makes it possible to produce
assembly code and/or a binary object executable by the associated FPGA. The
assembly instruction set used is specific to the project and is used by the
cross-assembler to produce the object code. The compiler is implemented in Lex,
Yacc and C; the cross-assembler is developed in Python. The cross-assembler also
performs code optimization operations in two passes and allows the use of
registers.

To get started and to compile one of the examples (see Makefile and example/),
use:

$ make objet
